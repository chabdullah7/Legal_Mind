dated\\n13.09.2023. subsequently, another fir (present\\none) has been registered on 04.3 .2024 by the fia\\nauthorities regarding the same occurrence due to\\nschedule offences under the offices in respect of\\nbanks (special courts) ordinance 1984 and\\ninstead of section 408 ppc, section 409 ppc has\\nbeen applied to the case of petitioner, as such this\\nbail petition has been filed on fresh ground.\\n3.\\narguments of counsel for the parties\\nheard and record perused.\\n4.\\naccording to learned counsel for\\npetitioner, since modification has been made in\\nd\\nthe quantum of sentence carried by section 409\\nppc as mentioned in second schedule of the\\noffences in respect of banks (special courts)\\nj\\nordinance, 1984, and in view thereof due to the\\npunishment not falling within the prohibitory\\nclause of section 497 cr.p.c, the accused\\npetitioner has now become entitled to the\\nconcession of bail. the contention so made by\\nlearned counsel for petitioner is misconceived\\nbecause the earlier bail petition was not dismissed\\nbecause of the sentence carried by the section of\\nlaw i.e. section 408 ppc but because of the\\nembargo under section 5 (6) of the offences in\\nrespect of banks (special courts) ordinance\\n1984 (ordinance no. ix of 1984) on grant of bail\\nan accused person who has been guilty of a\\nto\\n(\\nscheduled offence, as such, the ground taken by\\nthe petitioner cannot be termed as a fresh ground\\nbecause the prohibition contained in section 5 (6)\\nof the offences in respect of banks (special\\ncourts) ordinance 1984 (ordinance no. ix of\\nt\\n4\\nv\\n1984) still remains there. the counsel for\\npetitioner when confronted, stated that instead of\\nthe fresh ground taken in the bail petition, the\\ninstant bail application be decided in view of the\\n3rd proviso to section 497 cr.p.c, as the accused\\npetitioner is behind the bars for more than a yeat\\nand his trial has not been concluded. as such, this\\nbail petition is to be decided on fresh ground of\\ndelay in conclusion of trial of accused petitioner.\\n5\\npara (a) to 3\\'d proviso to section 497 (l)\\ncr.p.c says that if an accused person is detained\\ncontinuousty for a period exceeding one year for\\nan offence not punishable with death and his trial\\nhas not been concluded, he has a statutory right to\\nbe released on bail. the same being relevant is\\nreproduced as under:\\n(a). who, being accused of any\\noffence not punishable with\\ndeath, has been detained for\\n(\\n5\\nsuch offence for a continous\\nperiod exceeding one year or in\\ncase of a woman exceeding six\\nmonths and whose trial for such\\noffence has not\\nbeen\\nconcluded.\"\\nin the instant case, the section of\\nlaw applied against the accused petitioner does\\nnot carry death penalty coupled with the fact that\\ntrial of the accused petitioner has not even\\ncornmenced what to say of its completion. thus,\\nthe case of petitioner is covered under paru (a) to\\n3\\'d proviso to section 497 (1) cr.p.c.\\nbail under 3\\'d proviso to section 497 (l)\\n6\\ncr.p.c can be refused to an accused by the court\\nonly on two grounds i..e one mentioned in 3\\'d\\nproviso itself \"that the delay in the trial of the\\naccused has been occasioned by an act or\\nomission of the accused or any other person\\nacting on his behalf\\'and the second mentioned in\\n4th proviso that \"the accused is a previously\\n6\\nconvicted offender for an offence punishable with\\ndeath or imprisonment for lfe or to a person who\\nin the opinion of the court rs a hardened,\\ndesperate or dangerous crtminal or is accused of\\non act of teruorism punishable with death or\\nimprisonment for ltfe\".\\nnothing has been\\nbrought on record that the delay in conclusion of\\ntrial has been occasioned on part of the accused\\npetitioner or any other person acting on his behalf\\nor that he is an offender covered by the 4ft proviso\\nto section 497 (l)

were convicted under section 302\\nppc for the murder of nine deceased and sentenced them to\\ndeath under each count by learned trial court vide\\njudgment dated 21.12.2002.\\n3.\\nlateron, petitioner/convict niazuddin effected\\ncompromise with legal heirs of deceased and filed\\napplication before the learned trial court for his acquittal\\non the basis of compromise. the learned court below\\nrecorded statements of some of legal heirs of deceased but\\nsome\\nof\\nthem\\nwell\\nmentioned\\nin\\nthe\\nimpugned\\norder/judgment dated 22.12.2014 did not record their\\nstatements, as such provisions contained in section 345\\ncr.pc was not fulfilled therefore, the application of\\npetitioner/convict under section 338e ppc was turned\\ndown by learned trial court vide above order. lateron,\\npetitioner/ convict submitted another application before\\nthe learned trial court for remission of death sentence on\\nthe basis of compromise, which was also turned down vide\\nimpugned order dated 5.12.2017, hence the instant criminal\\nrevision has been preferred by petitioner/convict for\\n3\\nremission of his death penalty (9 counts) as well as his\\nrelease from jail on the basis of partial compromise.\\n4.\\nthe instant case was fixed for 5.3.2019 before\\nthis court, on which date the left over legal heirs of\\ndeceased appeared in court and conceded that they have\\nalso effected compromise with the petitioner/convict\\nhowever, for satisfaction, this court sent the case to the\\nlearned trial court to record statements of those legal heirs\\nwho were not examined during course of pendency of\\napplication under section 338e ppc. the learned trial\\ncourt after recording statements of legal heirs submitted its\\nreport before this court, according to which all the legal\\nheirs of nine deceased have effected compromise with the\\npetitioner/ convict.\\n5.\\nnow adverting to the relief asked by the\\npresent petitioner for his release and remission on the basis\\nof partial compromise, which in view of section 345 cr.pc\\nwas not possible however during pendency of instant\\ncriminal revision petition, as per report of learned trial\\ncourt below, all the legal heirs of nine deceased have\\neffected compromise with the petitioner/convict so the\\nrelief was amended verbally by learned counsel for\\n4\\npetitioner/convict with the prayer to acquit the petitioner\\non the basis of compromise.\\n6.\\nno doubt, the offences falling under chapter\\nxxiv\\nof\\nthe\\ncriminal\\nprocedure\\ncode\\n1898,\\nis\\ncompoundable however, it is admitted that the appeal filed\\nby petitioner/convict against his conviction has already\\nbeen dismissed by this court and this court ceased of the\\nmatter while on the other hand subsection 2 of section\\n338e ppc, empowers, confers jurisdiction only upon the\\ntrial court for determination.\\n7.\\nas this is a criminal revision petition, which is\\nalso against an order rendered under section 338e ppc, by\\nlearned trial court below so this court while exercising its\\njurisdiction under section 435/ 439 cr.pc, have no\\njurisdiction at all to acquit the accused on the basis of\\ncompromise keeping in view sub section 2 of section 338e\\nppc. however, the application under section 338e ppc\\nfiled by petitioner was dismissed by learned trial court in\\nview of section 345 cr.pc, where compromise was not\\neffected by all the legal heirs of nine deceased. so now when\\nall the legal heirs of deceased have effected compromise\\nwith the petitioner/convict therefore, this criminal revision\\n5\\npetition is allowed and the case is remanded to the learned\\ntrial court in view of sub section 2 of section 338e ppc for\\nfurther proceedings.\\n8.\\nbefore parting with the judgment, it would be\\nexpedient to give reference to the amendment introduced\\nthrough act xliii of 2016 dated 22.10.2016, which reads\\nas:\\n“provided further that where an\\noffence under this

The court also noted that the absence of incriminating material against the accused, along with the insistence of the police to arrest him, can indicate malafide on the part of the complainant and the police.\n",

            "The court held that the criteria for granting pre-arrest bail should not solely rely on the presence of malafide on the part of the complainant or police but should also consider the absence of incriminating material against the accused. The petitioner was granted pre-arrest bail after cooperating with the police investigation, and the bail was confirmed upon fulfilling the necessary requirements.\n"
